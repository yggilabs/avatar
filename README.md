### Eternally Bound

You are bound to a summoner. You do not require food or drink and you stop aging from the passage of time. The summoner's statistics can be found in Appendix A, at the end of this document.

Your summoner acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, ~~it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn~~ it acts on your turn (because this is just a million times simpler). Your summoner can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal. When you or your summoner dies, you are banished to a harmless demiplane and your bond is broken. While there, you are incapacitated. When you become unbound from your summoner, you will become bound to a new summoner in no more than 1d4 centuries.

While your summoner is the same plane of existence, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your summoners eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that your summoner has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

When you cast a spell, your summoner can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your summoner must be on the same plane of existence as you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll or saving throw, you use your spell casting statistics.

### Magic Initiate

You gain *magic initiate* as a bonus feat.

### Uncanny Armaments

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.

### Channeled Fury

When you use your action to cast a cantrip, you may make a single attack as a bonus action.

### Combined Assault

Once during your turn, when your bound summoner damages a creature (including damage as a result of delivering one of your spells) you may mark them until the end of your next turn. When you damage a creature marked by this feature, you may deal your resonance as bonus psychic damage. You may use this extra damage only once per turn.

### Summoner's Devotion

Beginning at 2nd level, your bound summoner increases its maximum hit points by three times your avatar level.

When you or your summoner reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you both gain temporary hit points equal to your avatar level.

Additionally, when your summoner takes damage, you may use your reaction to reduce that damage to 0. You take the amount of damage reduced as psychic damage. 

### Harmonic Form

Beginning at 2nd level, when you make make an attack on your turn, you can enter *Harmonic Form* as a part of the attack.

While under the effects of *Harmonic Form*, you gain the following benefits:

* When you would roll your resonance dice, the result of each die is the maximum possible result.
* As reaction, when you take damage you may reduce that damage by your resonance.

Your *Harmonic Form* lasts until the end of your next turn. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious. You can also end your *Harmonic Form* on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have entered *Harmonic Form* a number of times equal to your insight, you must finish a long rest before you can use *Harmonic Form* again.

### Apotheosis

Starting at 3rd level, Any summoner bound to you manifests a distinctive trait. Choose one of the following as your apotheosis:

* **Marked** The summoner's flesh bears bear your indelible mark. Your summoner gains resistance to magic and advantage on saving throws against magical effects.

* **Transformed** The summoner changes its own flesh with that of your own. Your summoner gains resistance to piercing, slashing and bludgeoning damage from non-magical weapons and has advantage on dexterity saving throws from effects it can see.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you canâ€™t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

### Summoner's Revenge

Beginning at 6th level, when you use Summoner's Devotion on damage from a creature, you gain resistance to the damage and the triggering creature takes an equal amount of psychic damage. You cannot use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.
